        Hello my name is Chastin Taylor
        I am from Winston-Salem NC and have lived there all my life.
        I am currently 20 years old (turning 21 in about 3 weeks) and I have a little sister and an older brother that I used to live with,
        but currently I live in an apartment by myself.
        I am currently a junior computer science student with a expected graduation in 2024.
        Some things about me is that I like videogames(Nintendo and Playstation),boxing,movies (action, comedy, horror) and
        anime. My dream job is to become  game developer and create games that people will enjoy
        <br><br>
        My days are usually me staying at my computer working on whatever assignment immediately when given or taking notes
        early, after that at around 8, I stop working if I feel that I did enough for today and just watch youtube and text my girlfriend if
        I have nowhere or nothing to do such as meetings/work for my internship or hanging out with my friends.
    </p>
