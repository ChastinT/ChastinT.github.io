                I learned java in highschool in the 11th Grade and have been continually improving since,
                <br>
                it is currently the language I use most</td>

            <td>C++</td>
            <td>
                I learned C++, I think in sophomore year in I think Data Structures.
                <br>
                Learning C++ seemed hard at first, but it's very similar to Java just with small differences and limitations

            <td>C#</td>
            <td>
                I am self-taught in C# and have been using it mostly for game development using Unity,
                <br>
                while initially it was confusing but due to my current internship and self-study I think I've improved quite a lot

                It has always been my dream to make videogames and when I got here at A&T I wanted to learn how to make them as quick as possible.
                <br>
                After my first year I saw that it was going to take alot of work to make even one game and that it would be a while before I could take
                a class in game development, so I started to study it by myself.
                <br>
                Thanks to my solo project that I'm currently working on (if I ever have time for it) and my internship, I'm slowly getting better but I know I still have a lot more to learn.

            <td>Pixel Art</td>
            <td>
                In highschool I came to the realization that I needed an artist,I didn't want to bother my older cousin
                <br>
                So not wanting to bother anyone or not knowing anyone at the time while in Computer class I started to use piskel and made pixel art
                of things that I thought look fun or tried something original
                <br>
                I have improved a good amount but I still consider myself a beginner.
